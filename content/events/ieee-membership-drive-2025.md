## IEEE-VSIT Membership Drive 2025-26

The **IEEE-VSIT Student Branch** successfully organized the **Membership Drive 2025–26**, a week-long initiative aimed at introducing students—particularly first-year students—to the benefits of joining the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** and the **Women in Engineering (WIE)** affinity group. The initiative took place throughout the first week of September and culminated in a main session held on **September 5, 2025**, from **3:00 PM to 5:00 PM**.

The session was led by **Soham Darekar**, Chairperson of the IEEE-VSIT Student Branch, who welcomed all attendees and provided an insightful overview of IEEE. He emphasized its global presence and the numerous academic, professional, and technical opportunities available to members — including **access to international journals**, **conference participation**, **networking with global professionals**, and **leadership development**.

A special segment highlighted the **Women in Engineering (WIE)** affinity group, focusing on its mission to **empower and support women in STEM**. This was followed by a **live demonstration** of the IEEE membership registration process, guiding participants through account creation, form completion, and membership selection.

The event concluded with an **interactive Q&A session**, where students clarified their doubts and shared their motivations for joining IEEE. Several attendees registered as members during the session itself, marking the drive as a success in fostering new engagement and awareness about IEEE’s value.
